# Tutorial Reflection

**Git Basics Tutorial**  
In this tutorial, I learned:
1. How to initialize a Git repository using `git init`.
2. How to stage files using `git add`.
3. How to commit changes with meaningful messages using `git commit`.
4. How to create a remote repository on GitHub and connect it to a local repository.
5. How to push changes to GitHub using `git push`.

These steps form the foundation of version control and are essential for collaborating on projects.
